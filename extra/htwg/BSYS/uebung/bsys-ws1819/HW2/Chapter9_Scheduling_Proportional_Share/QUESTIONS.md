This program, `lottery.py`, allows you to see how a lottery scheduler works.
See the README for details.

# Questions

1.  Compute the solutions for simulations with 3 jobs and random seeds of 1,
    2, and 3.

2.  Now run with two specific jobs: each of length 10, but one (job 0) with
    just 1 ticket and the other (job 1) with 100 (e.g., `-l 10:1,10:100`). What
    happens when the number of tickets is so imbalanced? Will job 0 ever run
    before job 1 completes? How often? In general, what does such a ticket
    imbalance do to the behavior of lottery scheduling?

3.  When running with two jobs of length 100 and equal ticket allocations of 100
    (`-l 100:100,100:100`), how unfair is the scheduler? Run with some different
    random seeds to determine the (probabilistic) answer; let unfairness be
    determined by how much earlier one job finishes than the other.

4.  How does your answer to the previous question change as the quantum size
    (`-q`) gets larger?

5.  Can you make a version of the graph that is found in the chapter? What
    else would be worth exploring? How would the graph look with a stride
    scheduler?
