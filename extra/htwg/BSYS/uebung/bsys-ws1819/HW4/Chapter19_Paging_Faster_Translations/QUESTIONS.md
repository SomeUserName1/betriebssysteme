# Questions

1.  For timing, you’ll need to use a timer (e.g., gettimeofday()). How precise
    is such a timer? How long does an operation have to take in order for you
    to time it precisely? (this will help determine how many times, in a loop,
    you’ll have to repeat a page access in order to time it successfully)

    ![figure](https://github.com/LambdaBooy/bsys-ws1819/blob/master/HW4/Chapter19_Paging_Faster_Translations/figure.png "Figure 19.5: Discovering TLB Sizes and Miss Costs")  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Figure 19.5: Discovering TLB Sizes and Miss Costs

2.  Write the program, called `tlb.c`, that can roughly measure the cost of
    accessing each page. Inputs to the program should be: the number of pages to
    touch and the number of trials.

3.  Now write a script in your favorite scripting language (`csh`, `python`, etc.) to
    run this program, while varying the number of pages accessed from 1 up to
    a few thousand, perhaps incrementing by a factor of two per iteration. Run
    the script on different machines and gather some data. How many trials are
    needed to get reliable measurements?

4.  Next, graph the results, making a graph that looks similar to the one above.
    Use a good tool like `ploticus` or even `zplot`. Visualization usually makes
    the data much easier to digest; why do you think that is?

5.  One thing to watch out for is compiler optimization. Compilers do all sorts
    of clever things, including removing loops which increment values that no
    other part of the program subsequently uses. How can you ensure the compiler
    does not remove the main loop above from your TLB size estimator?

6.  Another thing to watch out for is the fact that most systems today ship with
    multiple CPUs, and each CPU, of course, has its own TLB hierarchy. To really
    get good measurements, you have to run your code on just one CPU,
    instead of letting the scheduler bounce it from one CPU to the next. How can
    you do that? (hint: look up “pinning a thread” on Google for some clues)  
    What will happen if you don’t do this, and the code moves from one CPU to
    the other?

7.  Another issue that might arise relates to initialization. If you don’t
    initialize the array `a` above before accessing it, the first time you
    access it will be very expensive, due to initial access costs such as demand
    zeroing. Will this affect your code and its timing? What can you do to
    counterbalance these potential costs?
