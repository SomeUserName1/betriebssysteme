# Homework (Code)

In this homework, you will gain some familiarity with memory allocation. First,
you’ll write some buggy programs (fun!). Then, you’ll use some tools to help you
find the bugs you inserted. Then, you will realize how awesome these tools are
and use them in the future, thus making yourself more happy and productive.
The tools are the debugger (e.g., gdb), and a memory-bug detector called
valgrind.

# Questions

1.  First, write a simple program called `null.c` that creates a pointer to an
    integer, sets it to `NULL`, and then tries to dereference it. Compile this into
    an executable called `null`. What happens when you run this program?

2.  Next, compile this program with symbol information included (with the `-g`
    flag). Doing so let’s put more information into the executable, enabling the
    debugger to access more useful information about variable names and the
    like. Run the program under the debugger by typing `gdb null` and then,
    once `gdb` is running, typing run. What does gdb show you?

3.  Finally, use the `valgrind` tool on this program. We’ll use the `memcheck`
    tool that is a part of `valgrind` to analyze what happens. Run this by
    typing in the following: `valgrind --leak-check=yes ./null`. What happens
    when you run this? Can you interpret the output from the tool?

4.  Write a simple program that allocates memory using `malloc()` but forgets
    to free it before exiting. What happens when this program runs? Can you use
    `gdb` to find any problems with it? How about `valgrind` (again with the
    `--leak-check=yes` flag)?

5.  Write a program that creates an array of integers called `data` of size 100
    using `malloc`; then, set `data[100]` to zero. What happens when you run
    this program? What happens when you run this program using valgrind? Is the
    program correct?

6.  Create a program that allocates an array of integers (as above), frees them,
    and then tries to print the value of one of the elements of the array. Does
    the program run? What happens when you use `valgrind` on it?

7.  Now pass a funny value to free (e.g., a pointer in the middle of the array
    you allocated above). What happens? Do you need tools to find this type of
    problem?

8.  Try out some of the other interfaces to memory allocation. For example,
    create a simple vector-like data structure and related routines that use
    `realloc()` to manage the vector. Use an array to store the vectors elements;
    when a user adds an entry to the vector, use `realloc()` to allocate more
    space for it. How well does such a vector perform? How does it compare to a
    linked list? Use `valgrind` to help you find bugs.

9.  Spend more time and read about using `gdb` and `valgrind`. Knowing your
    tools is critical; spend the time and learn how to become an expert debugger
    in the UNIX and C environment.
