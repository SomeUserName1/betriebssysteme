/* Swoosch takes a pointer to a string (char pointer). Swoosch loops over
 * the characters of the String, until the String ends or there is a space.
 * The String pointer is incremented, so it points to the found space or nul.
 * Then it is checked, if this location is a space. If it's a space, nul is
 * written there and the pointer is incremented again. Finally the initial
 * location of the pointer is returned. Simplified, swoosch writes nul after
 * the first word, sets the string beginning to the first char after nul and
 * returns the initial beginning of the string.
